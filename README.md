<h3> My first Full-Stack App Built for a Customer </h3>

<h4> This project was built using: </h4> 
- React <br/>
- React-Router-Dom <br/>
- Google Firestore (DB) <br/>
- Google Firebase (uAuth) <br/>
- CSS<br/>
<br/>
The goal of this project is to enhance business operations, 
specifically by recording the times employees punch in, break or out. 
The owners can retrieve the data from google firestore's portal.<br/>

So far, it seems like the app is making the employees more accountable 
and the owners have confirmed more accurate pay, since the data is available. <br/>

So in essence, this app which I developed streamlined business operations and 
enhanced employee accountability which are always welcomed improvements. <br/>

I will be making some updates to this project and eventually expand it to other businesses,
with light styling modifications to match the business's theme. <br/>

<h4> Possible Future Updates:</h4> 
1. Will add a collection to the DB storing the users, specifically what type of user (manager || employee)
   if manager -> Will have access to a page grouping all the punched in times and be able to manipulate the data.<br/>
2. Will be adding a darkmode/lightmode switch (still thinking about it)<br/>
